/*
two non-negative numbers n and m

similar if their decimal representation can be obtained from each other by rearranging their digits. 

Note that a correct decimal representation does not contain leading zeroes

1234 is similar to 2431
1010 is similar to 1001
12 is similar to 12
123 is not similar to 234
113 is not similar to 133
100 is not similar to 10

Input: non-negative integer N
Output: number of non-negative integer similar to N
